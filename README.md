# Heat_transfer


Here you will find an interactive GUI made in MATLAB to simulate the temperature profile on a 2D steady state plate. You will be able to choose your own boundary conditions (constant temperature or isolated edge). 

In addition, you have the code for an unsteady state (transient) heat diffusion for a 1D bar (you have to enter the properties of your bar, since it is in a transient state).
